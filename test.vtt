Hi, my name is James and this will be my fourth year teaching on the Pre-sessional 

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:09.800
course at Manchester University. The thing that I like most about teaching at Manchester 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.300
University is that, of course, my students are really good fun to work with, but 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.500
I'm always amazed at the progress that my students make throughout the course, they 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.400
become much more confident in their academic English skills, and I really think 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.500
that this improves the quality of their experience at Manchester University going 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.900
forward. So, thinking about learning 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:34.700
online. I've been teaching online now for the past year or so, and I really think 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:41.800
it can be equally as rewarding as learning face to face. A lot of the tasks that 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:47.300
I set you will ask you to work in small groups on Zoom and whilst you're working, 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:53.300
I can come into your breakout groups and I can visit you, and I think that my students 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.700
often feel that this is 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.800
more of a personal one-on-one experience with their teacher, as they don't sometimes 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:07.100
feel the pressures that they might feel when they're speaking in front of a class 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.300
in a face-to-face setting. Over the course, weï¿½ll look at a range of academic English 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.800
Skills, of course, including speaking, which includes presentation skills, and how 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.300
to participate in seminars. 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:26.000
Going forward, looking past covid-19, we might well be expected to attend more meetings 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.700
online, to give more presentations online. So I really think that communicating effectively 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:40.000
online, for me, is a skill which isn't just valuable, but essential going forward. 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.600
So, I really hope that you can join us on the Pre-sessional course this year and 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.700
I look forward to meeting you.
